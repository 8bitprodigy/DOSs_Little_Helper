# DOS's Little Helper library


A set of helper libraries for making your own DOS games/programs(wip).
Just copy them into your source directory, or however you're doing your project.

Currently, these are a work in progress.

There is:

1. VGA's Little Helper Lib
    * Supports Mode13
    * Do not plot pixels outside of the screen -- there are no safety checks and you will corrupt memory.

And that's it (so far).
